 - Everything is same just as single table strategy only difference being it creates different tables per entity instead of merging everything into one.
 - Discriminator annotations are not needed as data is stored in separate tables.

 	@Inheritance (strategy=InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)

 	Table struct:

 	Vehicle:
 	- VehicleId
 	- VehicleName

 	TwoWheeler:
 	- VehicleId
 	- VehicleName
 	-SteeringHandle

 	FourWheeler:
 	- VehicleId
 	- VehicleName
 	-SteeringWheel

 - Do note that this type of strategy allows you to create separate tables but it repeats parent column in child tables.
