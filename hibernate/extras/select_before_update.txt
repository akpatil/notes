 - Persisting data to database using hibernate goes through 3 phases. 
 	Transient
 	Persistent
 	Detached Object
 - Once an object becomes detached, in order to make it persistent again and to save changes automatically to database we need to supply session.update() command.
 - But at times doing so may lead to loss of data as hibernate doesnt check for previous value before doing update.
 - To enforce hibernate to make select before update, we use a native hibernate Entity annotation

 	@Entity // standard JPA annotation
 	@org.hibernate.annotations.Entity (selectBeforeUpdate=true) // native hibernate annotation
 	public class User {
 		...
 	}
