 - One To One mapping allows addition of an additional column in the main parent table just like @Embedded/@Embeddable annotation except for the rest of the columns are added in a separate table.
 - It maintains a reference of primary key in the parent table.

 	public class User {
 		@Id
 		@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
 		private Integer userid;
 		private String username;

 		@OneToOne
 		private Vehicle vehicle;
 	}

 	public class Vehicle {
 		private Integer vehicleId;
 		private String vehicleName;
 	}

 	User Table:
 	- userid
 	- username
 	- user_vehicle_id

 	Vehicle Table:
 	- vehicleId
 	- vehicleName

 - To rename mapping column use @JoinTable annotation

 	@OneToOne
 	@JoinTable (joincolumns=@JoinColumn(name="vehicle_id"))
 	private Vehicle vehicle;
