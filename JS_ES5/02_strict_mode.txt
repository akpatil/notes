 - javascript allows you to write scripts without using line termination symbol ";" semi-colon.
 - it also allows you to declare variables without using "var" keyword by escalating the variable declared to the global scope.
 - now this is generally considered a bad practice as it polutes global scope and lack of semi-colons makes the code less verbose and unreadable.

 	variable1 = 5 // no semi-colons and no var declaration
 	console.log(variable1)

 - to prevent such bad coding practices, javascript allows us to enable strict mode while writing scripts to throw error.

 	"use strict"
